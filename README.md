# Network Intrusion Detection System

## Overview

This project implements a Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. The system is designed to identify and classify various types of network attacks.

## Objectives

- To preprocess the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, including converting categorical variables into dummy variables.
- To implement various classification algorithms including Decision Trees, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forests for intrusion detection.
- To evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [KDD Cup 1999](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html), which contains a wide range of network connections labeled as normal or different types of attacks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/masters-project-network-intrusion-detection.git
   cd masters-project-network-intrusion-detection
   ```

2. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

To run the project, execute the following Python script:

```bash
python intrusion_detection.py
```

This script includes the complete pipeline from data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The models were evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrices, showing the classification performance for different types of network intrusions. The results of the evaluation metrics are printed to the console.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques for network intrusion detection, providing a framework for further enhancements and real-world application.
